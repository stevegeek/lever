# Changelog

All notable changes to lever are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Process: every merge
to `main` that changes behavior adds an entry under `## [Unreleased]`; a
version bump moves the block under the new version heading.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `lever reload`: apply config changes (new grove, tool, or grant) to a running
  instance without a VM power cycle — restarts the broker on the current config
  while leaving the manager container (and its conversation) running.

### Fixed
- Revocation now fails closed on every path: a revoked agent can no longer mint
  or delegate capability tokens (previously only its tool calls were denied at
  the gateway, so it could still delegate a token bound to a non-revoked agent)
  nor message other agents.

### Docs
- New "Capabilities" and "Operations & recipes" guides; a "CLI" reference page;
  a security-model section on what a compromised agent can and can't do;
  disclosures on token-in-LLM-context (safe via CN-binding), the subscription
  vs api-key trade, and tree-resident boot material persisting across `--fresh`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Operator skills: framework-authored `lever-operator` (manager) and
  `lever-agent` (grove) SKILL.md files teaching agents the capability flow
  (mint via `lever-capability` `request`, attach as `_capability`), messaging,
  and grove dispatch.
- `lever init [--force] [--check]`: scaffolds the skills into the instance
  tree (tree root + each declared grove dir) with hash-guarded updates
  (locally-modified files are skipped with a warning unless `--force`) and an
  idempotent marker block in the tree-root CLAUDE.md.
- `lever doctor` check "operator skills": present / current / unmodified /
  CLAUDE.md block present.
- Skill files carry a `lever-version` frontmatter stamp.

### Changed
- Version is now `0.2.0` (was `0.0.0-dev`).

## [0.1.0] - pre-changelog era

Everything before this changelog: the containment jail (OrbStack/Lima
backends, egress allowlisting), the capability broker and mTLS gateway
(enrolment, typed tokens, MCP-aware `_capability` gating, `/llm` api-key
proxy), external MCP tools, broker-routed messaging, resume-reconciliation
(`lever stop`/`up` restores the manager conversation), and `lever doctor`.
See git history for details.
